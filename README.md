The FIFA World Cup is the most prestigious football tournament in the world. The championship has been awarded every four years since the start of the tournament in 1930.

In this Project, we will use https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brenda89/fifa-world-cup-2022.

**Project Description**

The FIFA World Cup involves a qualification phase, which takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams quality for the tournament. In the tournament, 32 teams, including the host nation, compete for the title at different stadiums in the host country.

This dataset provides a complete overview of all international soccer matches played since the 90s. On top of that, the strength of each team is provided by incorporating actual FIFA rankings as well as player strengths based on the EA Sport FIFA video game.

**Performance Metric**

In this project we will try to · Which team has the longest winning streak. Is there any home team advantage?

**Assignment 2 Comments (from phillijo)**
- This seems like a pretty cool idea!
- It might be interesting to explore whether your model can predict the winner of a head-to-head matchup between two given teams based on their performances in previous World Cups, or based on previous head-to-head matchups between the same teams.
